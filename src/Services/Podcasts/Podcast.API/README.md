### Compose

The easiest way to run your backend services locally is using _Compose_. To run the services type `docker-compose up` from terminal located in the root folder. This will build (if needed) the Docker images and bring up all the containers.

### Visual Studio

Run `docker-compose up -d podcast.db storage` from terminal located in the root folder. 

Open Visual Studio select Podcast.Api as start up project and hit f5.

## Deploy using GitHub Actions

To configure the Github Action it is necessary to create an environment called `prod` and set up the following secrets. (Consider that the action will create these resources automatically, so resource names need to be unique).
